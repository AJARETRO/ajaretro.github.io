            <h1>How Much Does a Website Cost in Bangladesh? (2025 Guide)</h1>
            <p class="text-gray-400">Published on August 22, 2025 by AJA RETRO</p>
            
            <p>One of the first questions any business owner in Bangladesh asks when considering a new online presence is: "How much will it cost?" The answer isn't always simple, as the price of a website can vary dramatically based on its complexity and features. In this guide, we'll break down the typical costs to give you a clear understanding of what to expect.</p>

            <blockquote>A website is an investment, not an expense. A good website will generate more revenue than it costs to build.</blockquote>

            <h2>Understanding the Key Factors</h2>
            <p>Before we get to the numbers, let's look at what influences the final price:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Number of Pages:</strong> A simple 5-page site is cheaper than a 20-page corporate site.</li>
                <li><strong>Custom Design vs. Template:</strong> A unique, custom-designed website will cost more than one built from a pre-made template.</li>
                <li><strong>E-commerce Functionality:</strong> Selling products online requires complex features like payment gateways, which increases the cost.</li>
                <li><strong>Content Management System (CMS):</strong> A site with a CMS (like WordPress) that allows you to update content yourself costs more upfront but saves money later.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Typical Website Price Ranges in Bangladesh</h2>
            <p>Here are some realistic price ranges you can expect in the current market.</p>

            <h3>1. Basic Static Website (10,000tk - 25,000tk)</h3>
            <p>This is the entry-level option, perfect for small businesses, portfolios, or individuals who need a professional online brochure. It's a "what you see is what you get" site where the developer makes any updates.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pages:</strong> 3-5 pages (e.g., Home, About, Services, Contact).</li>
                <li><strong>Features:</strong> Mobile-responsive design, contact form, social media links.</li>
                <li><strong>Best for:</strong> Businesses that don't need to update content frequently.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Standard Business Website with CMS (25,000tk - 60,000tk)</h3>
            <p>This is the most popular choice for growing businesses. Built on a platform like WordPress, it gives you the power to manage your own content, such as adding blog posts or updating service information.</p>
             <ul>
                <li><strong>Pages:</strong> 5-15 pages.</li>
                <li><strong>Features:</strong> Everything in the basic package, plus a blog, admin dashboard, and basic SEO setup.</li>
                <li><strong>Best for:</strong> Companies that want to actively manage their online presence and content marketing.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. E-commerce Website (50,000tk - 200,000tk+)</h3>
            <p>For businesses looking to sell products online, an e-commerce site is essential. The **e-commerce website price in Bangladesh** varies widely based on complexity.</p>
             <ul>
                <li><strong>Features:</strong> Product pages, shopping cart, secure checkout, integration with local payment gateways (bKash, Nagad, etc.), and an order management system.</li>
                <li><strong>The price depends heavily on:</strong> The number of products, complexity of shipping rules, and any custom features required.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Don't Forget Ongoing Costs</h2>
            <p>Building the site is just the first step. Remember to budget for these recurring costs:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Domain Name:</strong> Around 1,500tk per year for a .com domain.</li>
                <li><strong>Web Hosting:</strong> Quality hosting with support, like our Hosting & Care plan, typically starts around 1,000tk per month.</li>
            </ul>
